## Dormarch

*Retrieving SSH and GPS keys from GitHub and GitLab*

### About

This project was born from a real necessity: being able to track and retrieve colleagues' SSH keys. Not everybody knows, you can download them from GitLab and GitHub, if they are available.

So, I chose to create a small utility to do the job for me, and especially using the occasion to tries technologies I haven't used before, such Rust and its ecosystem, GitHub Actions and its ecosystem.

It is basically a project to learn new things, including some useful Rust libraries, how to properly test them, how `crates.io` works, and how to build and publish Rust software with GitHub Actions.

Any feedback, in the form of issues and pull requests, is more than welcome!

#### Why the name "Dormarch"?

> Dormarch [...] is a hound, normally used to assist hunters by tracking or chasing the animal that is being hunted.

I spend time hunting colleagues' keys, so why not having a helper?
